Background
======
New technology is a double-edged sword, bringing hope to the future of human society and at the same time bringing crisis to mankind. The large-scale power outage in India has affected 600 million people, and the development of AI technology and DNA technology has also made many technology practitioners worry about the technology-oriented future of mankind (Maynard, 2015)。

As an engineer, it is important to learn to build technologies that do not harm the environment. A good engineer should build an engineering system that will not harm the surrounding environment, which is a more robust and trustworthy engineering system. Considering its impact on society, the environment, and ethics in the use of technology makes engineer’s own technology sustainable and better preserved. Avoiding the construction of technologies that negatively impact any individual, community, environment can benefit social well-being (Tavakoli Nabavi, 2023)。

Methodology
======
Through specfic thinking, engineers can avoid having their technology negatively impact the interactive environment. The theory of responsible innovation (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten, 2013; De Hoop, Pols & Romijn, 2016; Owen, Macnaghten & Stilgoe, 2012)) proposed a high-level thinking framework to guide engineers in such thinking. It proposes four directions of thinking, namely: Anticipation, Reflexivity, Inclusion and Responsiveness. Anticipation means that researchers have to foresee the results of their technology, reflexivity means that engineers have the responsibility to evaluate their own technology morally and ethically, and inclusion means that engineers should take opinions from the stakeholders and the wider public into consideration, responsiveness means that engineers should ensure that their innovations can make timely changes based on changing stakeholder requirements and public values. Engineers need to take these foresights, evaluation, considerations, and external requirements as references, and adjust their own technology development direction or process to ensure that their technology is responsible.

List of KPIs for responsible innovation (Tavakoli Nabavi, 2023) presents many classic points for consideration in current technology development, which are also useful for responsible technology innovation and implementation.

We combined anticipation-reflextivity-inclusion-responsiveness with the KPI list, transformed the theory into specific self-assessment questions, proposed a question-based guideline to help engineers evaluate whether their technology meets the requirements of responsible engineering thinking and practice standards, and give them relevant tips and behavioral guidance.

Guideline
======
By answering the following questions, the engineer can more clearly judge whether his behavior meets the requirements, and what he can do.

**1.Anticipation Analysis:**

What are the possible economic, social or environmental impacts of your project's outputs?

Does your project use cutting-edge methods? What are the positive and negative impacts of such an approach?

Have you conducted a technical assessment of the parts of the project that may have an impact on the external environment and proposed corresponding solutions?

Are there any potential unintended impacts of your project that would occur under certain conditions?

**2.Refelxity and Evaluation：**

Does the underlying motivation, purpose of your project have a potential impact to the external environment?

During the process of your project, did you encounter a situation outside the usual regulatory domain? How do you deal with such unknown situations, uncertainties, risks and ethical dilemmas?

When your project is faced with many uncertain situations, have you put forward corresponding assumptions and conducted risk assessment?

**3.Inclusion Anlysis：**

How do you gather perspectives from different stakeholders and the public on a project?

How do you ensure participatory, transparent and representative public engagement?

How do you incorporate multiple perspectives into the decision-making process for a project during the decision-making process?

**4.Responsiveness and Flexibility：**

During this project, how would you respond to questions from stakeholders and the public?

In this project, how would you respond to the different values raised by stakeholders and the public?

What are the characteristics of your project to ensure that it can adapt to the changing environment?

How do you react to new knowledge, perspectives and norms and incorporate them into the continual improvement and adaptation of the project?

Does your project have a feedback mechanism that allows it to adapt the shape of the project based on the views and ideas of other stakeholders?

**Qustions based on List of KPIs for responsible innovation (Tavakoli Nabavi, 2023)：**

**Diversity and Inclusion:**

How do you ensure equal participation of men and women in research and project management?

In your project, how do you progressively remove barriers that prevent women from advancing and exiting science?

What tools and mechanisms are in place in your project to enable dialogue with stakeholders about project’ s ethical acceptability?

**Open and transparent:**

Do you actively communicate project outcomes and disclose ethical practices that exist within the project?

How do you incorporate input from different stakeholders, including end users, indirect stakeholders, suppliers, funders, civil society groups and policy makers, during the design and development process?

**Environmental Sustainability:**

Have environmental values influenced the implementation of your project?

How does your project improve resource utilization efficiency, reduce pollution emissions, and apply the theory of sustainable development?

Will your project have harmful impacts on the ecosystem or the environment, and what steps are you taking to avoid these damages?

**Social Sustainability:**

How does your project take social values (e.g. privacy, safety, health, security, data ownership) into account?

What steps has your project taken to ensure that project outcomes are socially implementable and to overcome possible trust issues?

Result Analysis
======
If you have clear answers to the above questions, congratulations on your complete thinking on the responsible innovation and implementation of your project!

If you are confident that the mechanisms in your project can prevent you from all the possible problems mentioned in the guideline, well done! You are a responsible engineer!

If your answers to the questions are vague, please go through them again until you can clearly state your answers!

If you are not sure whether you have enough measures to deal with all the possible conditions mentions in the guideline, please think and discuss with your workmates!

To be a responsible engineer takes efforts but it worth! Good luck!
