For the first toolkit, we designed a game based on situational debate.
The core idea behind our game is to mimic complex situations that involve different systems and stakeholders, by giving diffrent events to activate the actions from each actor in the big system, we can observe how the subsyetms and actors in system interact with each other.


Introduction Of Design
======
We  select urban expansion as our game background, which is also a classic realistic topic in current developing world. The urban expansion will bring several problems. First, it will crowd out natural environment such as the farmland space, resource-use conflicts will happen bettwen the industy companies and the farmers. Second, when the city choose to develop it s economics by developing industry or manufacturing, there will be conflicts between ecosystem protection and local government wealth. Third, it will lead to problems of changes to the benefits of farmers and local citizens. Overally, how to develop a city influence benefits of all the stakeholders in the city-farm system.

By stakeholder analysis, we know the results are basically decided by the stakeholders with the higher power and higher influence, which refer to the government and companies. However, our game want to set an ideal situation that all the stakeholders except for the ecosystem have equal voice, even the marginalized stakeholders can use their words to persuade the government and industry companies re-consider their decisions and the interests of the marginalized ones.

By debating, the stakeholders can clearly speak out their needs. The interests of each stakeholder will be considered, this might can lead to a sustainable result.


Background
======
City A is facing a contradiction between environmental protection and economic development.
There is a fertile farmland surrounding the city, supplying city dwellers with fresh produce. However, as the city expands and its population grows, the government is under pressure to develop more land for commercial development. This has led to tensions and conflicts of interest between cities and farms.


Stakeholders
======
Farmers: focus on their agricultural production and livelihood. However, urban development requires land expropriation, causing farmers to worry about and lose resources.
City dwellers: want sustainable agricultural supplies and beautiful farm environments, but they also want more residential, industrial and commercial space to support the urban economy. Government officials: are under pressure to provide jobs, improve infrastructure and improve living standards for residents, but also protect the environment.
Environmental groups: have called for the protection of farmland and ecosystems, stressing the importance of sustainable agriculture and ecological balance. They worry that urban growth will lead to land destruction, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.
Urban planners: try to strike a balance between environment and urban development.
New industry enterprises: hope to replace farms for factory construction and use good ecological resources for product production. This will cause damage to the natural ecology, but it will have an immediate effect on the local economic development.
In this context, players will play different stakeholder roles. Under different decisions and challenges, they need to speak from their own interests, persuade each other, achieve their goals, and win points for themselves. The ideal outcome is for each stakeholder to have an even score, meaning that a balanced and sustainable solution has been found. If the end result is not as desired, one can explore what went wrong in the debate that tipped the balance of interest in a particular direction.

Through debate and reflection, we can collide with more strategies that are conducive to sustainable development of resources, and gain a deeper understanding of the complex systems involved in urban expansion.

Stakeholders:
Farmers, residents, government, environmental organizations, urban planners, new industry enterprises, ecological environment



Game rules
======
3 rounds, 7 players
1. The player chooses a stakeholder role and gets the corresponding role card.
2. The host announces the background of the current round. Players are invited to debate according to their own interests and role goals. The ecological environment player needs to remain silent.
3. Players vote. Scores the player based on whether the decision was reached or not. Players will know their scores only after the game is over, and they will compare their mentally expected scores with their actual scores and reflect on their actions.
4. Continue for three rounds
5. After the three rounds, all player scores and city development status will be announced. Players are invited to review their decisions and results based on player scores and city development status and discuss the interaction between systems and potential sustainable solutions. The ecological and environmental parties are invited to make independent speeches.


Example scenes
======

Acquisition of some farmland land to build heavy industrial factories that will bring profits and jobs.
Success: farmers +5, residents +5, government +10, environmental organizations -10, urban planners -5, new industry enterprises +10, ecological environment -10
Failure: Farmer +10, Resident +10, Government -5, Environmental Organization +5, City Planner +5, New Industry Enterprise -10, Ecological Environment +10

Second round scene:
Protect farmland areas and refuse to occupy farmland areas to develop any other industries. Build an agricultural ecological base, develop agricultural high-tech, and there may be high profits in 10 years.
Success: farmers +5, residents +5, government +5, environmental organizations +5, urban planners +5, new industry enterprises -10, ecological environment +10
Failure: Farmer -5, Resident +10, Government +10, Environmental Organization -5, Urban Planner +5, New Industry Enterprise +10, Ecological Environment -5

Third round scene:
Abandoning agricultural development, the city completely turned to other industries for development. Move all the population of the farmland area to the city.
Success: farmers +5, residents -5, government +5, environmental organizations -5, urban planners +5, new industry enterprises +10, ecological environment -10
Failure: farmers +5, residents +5, government -5, environmental organizations +5, urban planners +0, new industry enterprises -10, ecological environment +10


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
