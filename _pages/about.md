Author Notes  ðŸ““
======
This game is based on situational debates.

Complex situations that involve different systems and stakeholders will be simulated. Different actors will express different opinions about different events happening in the big system. We can observe how the actors and subsystems in a system interact with each other in the game.

Through the game, the players can better understand the concepts of stakeholder analysis and system analysis.



Background
======
![big-city-and-suburbs](/images/pngtree-beautiful-big-city-and-suburbs-png-image_5933752.jpeg)

City A is facing a contradiction between environmental protection and economic development.

There is a fertile farmland surrounding the city, supplying city dwellers with fresh produce. However, as the city expands and its population grows, the government is under pressure to develop more land for commercial development. This has led to tensions and conflicts of interest between cities and farms.



Stakeholders
======

Farmers, residents, government, environmental organizations, urban planners, new industry enterprises, ecosystem.



Stakeholder Contexts

![farmer](/images/farmer.png) Farmers: focus on their agricultural production and livelihood. However, urban development requires land expropriation, causing farmers to worry about and lose resources.




![Residents](/images/residents.jpeg) Residents: want sustainable agricultural supplies and beautiful farm environments, but they also want more residential, industrial, and commercial space to support the urban economy. 



![Government](/images/govern.png) Government: are under pressure to provide jobs, improve infrastructure and improve living standards for residents, but also protect the environment.



![Environmental ](/images/environ_group.jpeg) Environmental organizations: have called for the protection of farmland and ecosystems, stressing the importance of sustainable agriculture and ecological balance. They worry that urban growth will lead to land destruction, water shortages, and loss of biodiversity.



![Urban](/images/urbanPlanner.jpeg) Urban planners: try to strike a balance between environment and urban development.



![industry](/images/factory.png) New industry enterprises: hope to replace farms for factory construction and use good ecological resources for product production. This will cause damage to the natural ecology, but it will have an immediate effect on the local economic development.



![Ecosystem](/images/ecosystem.png) Ecosystem: Hope to protect the natural environment as better as possible




**What player should do in game**


Players will play different stakeholder roles. Under different decisions and challenges, they need to speak from their own interests, persuade each other, achieve their goals, and win points for themselves. 


**Ideal game score**


The ideal outcome is for each stakeholder to have an even score, meaning that a balanced and sustainable solution has been found. If the result is not as desired, one can explore what went wrong in the debate that tipped the balance of interest in a particular direction.


**Ideal game outcome**


Through debate and reflection, we can collide with more strategies that are conducive to the sustainable development of resources and gain a deeper understanding of the complex systems involved in urban expansion.


**Game rules**

5. After the three rounds, all player scores and city development status will be announced.


Players are invited to do the following things:

  --	 Read the scoring rules and discuss whether they are satisfied with the given game-scoring rules.
  
  >*This discussion is for the cost and gains for each stakeholder are subjective, we hope the stakeholders can be clear about what they want and how much effort is required for stakeholder communication by justifying our scoring system.*
  
    	 
       
  --	 They will discuss whether the score distribution is equal and what is their agreeable sustainable strategy for city development.
    
  >*This discussion is to summarize their opinions and test whether there can be a strategy that satisfies all requirements of the stakeholders.*
