Author Notes (emoji)
======
This game is based on situational debates.

Complex situations that involve different systems and stakeholders will be simulated. Different actors will express different opinions about different events happening in the big system. We can observe how the actors and subsystems in a system interact with each other in the game.
Through the game, the players can better understand the concepts of stakeholder analysis and system analysis.

Background
======
![big-city-and-suburbs](https://github.com/PP1toolkit/PP1toolkit.github.io/blob/master/images/pngtree-beautiful-big-city-and-suburbs-png-image_5933752.jpeg)
City A is facing a contradiction between environmental protection and economic development.

There is a fertile farmland surrounding the city, supplying city dwellers with fresh produce. However, as the city expands and its population grows, the government is under pressure to develop more land for commercial development. This has led to tensions and conflicts of interest between cities and farms.

Stakeholders
======

Farmers, residents, government, environmental organizations, urban planners, new industry enterprises, ecological environment

Stakeholder Contexts
======
Farmers: focus on their agricultural production and livelihood. However, urban development requires land expropriation, causing farmers to worry about and lose resources.

Residents: want sustainable agricultural supplies and beautiful farm environments, but they also want more residential, industrial, and commercial space to support the urban economy.

Government: are under pressure to provide jobs, improve infrastructure and improve living standards for residents, but also protect the environment.

Environmental organizations: have called for the protection of farmland and ecosystems, stressing the importance of sustainable agriculture and ecological balance. They worry that urban growth will lead to land destruction, water shortages, and loss of biodiversity.

Urban planners: try to strike a balance between environment and urban development.

New industry enterprises: hope to replace farms for factory construction and use good ecological resources for product production. This will cause damage to the natural ecology, but it will have an immediate effect on the local economic development.

Ecosystem: Hope to protect the natural environment as better as possible

In this context, players will play different stakeholder roles. Under different decisions and challenges, they need to speak from their own interests, persuade each other, achieve their goals, and win points for themselves. The ideal outcome is for each stakeholder to have an even score, meaning that a balanced and sustainable solution has been found. If the end result is not as desired, one can explore what went wrong in the debate that tipped the balance of interest in a particular direction.

Through debate and reflection, we can collide with more strategies that are conducive to sustainable development of resources, and gain a deeper understanding of the complex systems involved in urban expansion.

Game rules
======
3 rounds, 7 players
1. The player chooses a stakeholder role and gets the corresponding role card.
![game rule card](https://github.com/PP1toolkit/PP1toolkit.github.io/blob/master/images/game%20rule%20card.jpg)

2. The host announces the background of the current round. Players are invited to debate according to their own interests and role goals. The ecological environment player needs to remain silent.
![debate](https://github.com/PP1toolkit/PP1toolkit.github.io/blob/master/images/debate.png)

3. Players vote. Scores the player based on whether the decision was reached or not. Players will know their scores only after the game is over, and they will compare their mentally expected scores with their actual scores and reflect on their actions.

4. Continue for three rounds

5. After the three rounds, all player scores and city development status will be announced. Players are invited to review their decisions and results based on player scores and city development status and discuss the interaction between systems and potential sustainable solutions.


Round Background
======
Second round scene:

Acquisition of some farmland land to build heavy industrial factories that will bring profits and jobs.

Success: farmers +5, residents +5, government +10, environmental organizations -10, urban planners -5, new industry enterprises +10, ecological environment -10

Failure: Farmer +10, Resident +10, Government -5, Environmental Organization +5, City Planner +5, New Industry Enterprise -10, Ecological Environment +10

Second round scene:

Protect farmland areas and refuse to occupy farmland areas to develop any other industries. Build an agricultural ecological base, develop agricultural high-tech, and there may be high profits in 10 years.

Success: farmers +5, residents +5, government +5, environmental organizations +5, urban planners +5, new industry enterprises -10, ecological environment +10

Failure: Farmer -5, Resident +10, Government +10, Environmental Organization -5, Urban Planner +5, New Industry Enterprise +10, Ecological Environment -5

Third round scene:

Abandoning agricultural development, the city completely turned to other industries for development. Move all the population of the farmland area to the city.

Success: farmers +5, residents -5, government +5, environmental organizations -5, urban planners +5, new industry enterprises +10, ecological environment -10

Failure: farmers +5, residents +5, government -5, environmental organizations +5, urban planners +0, new industry enterprises -10, ecological environment +10
